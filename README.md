# NutriTrack AI - Project Proposal

## 1. The Product Vision
**The Problem:** People with dietary restrictions or specific health goals suffer from "decision fatigue" and manual tracking errors, leading to abandoned health journeys.
**The Solution:** NutriTrack AI is a smart meal-planning platform that automates recipe discovery based on health profiles, real-time pantry inventory, and caloric goals.

### Key Features (Initial Backlog)
1. **Health Profiler:** Set allergies, dietary labels (Keto, Vegan, etc.), and macro targets.
2. **AI Recipe Engine:** Fetches recipes from a 3rd-party API that strictly match user constraints.
3. **Pantry Inventory Manager:** Track what’s in your fridge to reduce food waste.
4. **Interactive Macro Dashboard:** Weekly visual reports on protein, carb, and fat intake.
5. **Smart Grocery List:** Automatically generates a shopping list based on the week's meal plan.

### User Personas
* **The Performance Athlete:** Needs high-protein meal automation for training cycles.
* **The Allergy-Conscious User:** Needs 100% certainty that recipes are gluten/nut-free.

## 2. Team Workflow
**Definition of Done (DoD):**
* Code passes linting/formatting.
* Feature branch is pushed and a Pull Request is opened.
* At least one teammate reviews and approves the PR.
* Feature is merged into `main` and verified.

**Communication:**
* **Slack:** Daily asynchronous updates in the `#team-nutritrack` channel.
* **Meetings:** Tuesdays (Sprint Planning) and Fridays (Retrospectives) at 5:00 PM via Zoom.

**Branching Strategy:**
We use a **Feature Branch** workflow. Example: `feature/user-login`. All code must be merged via **Pull Request**. No direct pushes to `main`.
